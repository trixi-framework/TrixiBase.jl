You can override specific assignments in elixir by supplying keyword arguments. It's basic purpose is to make it easier to modify some parameters while running Trixi.jl from the REPL. Additionally, this is used in tests to reduce the computational burden for CI while still providing examples with sensible default values for users.\n\nBefore replacing assignments in elixir, the keyword argument maxiters is inserted into calls to solve with it's default value used in the SciML ecosystem for ODEs, see the \"Miscellaneous\" section of the documentation.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> redirect_stdout(devnull) do\n         trixi_include(@__MODULE__, joinpath(examples_dir(), \"tree_1d_dgsem\", \"elixir_advection_extended.jl\"),\n                       tspan=(0.0, 0.1))\n         sol.t[end]\n       end\n[ Info: You just called `trixi_include`.
